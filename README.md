# TOP_Rock_Paper_Scissors
This project is to design a game of rock paper scissors to be played in the console.
Will add GUI at a later date.
Steps to complete game
    Have player input choose rock paper or scissors
    Have the computer randomly pick between rock paper or scissors
    Compare the two results and declare a winner or tie
    After one player wins 3 games delcare that player the winner
    Display you won or you lost based on who won the game
